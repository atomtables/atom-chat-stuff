# atom-chat-server

a socket.io server built to host the family of atom-chat apps

some examples of such apps:
AtomChat: android app built in java
AtomChat Online: http app built in npm
AtomChat python-cli: not likely to be made, but cli app built in python
*to be made* AtomChat python-gui: possibly will be made, and native app built in python

# THIS SERVER IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, AND SO ARE ANY ATOM-CHAT APPS
## use at your own risk, knowing there may be security debacles that haven't been fixed.
